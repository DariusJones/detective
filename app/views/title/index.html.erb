    <p>Abaddon. A cesspool of sin and broken dreams. The sounds of sirens and splashing puddles fills my ears as the cold night air stabs into my lungs with each step that I take down this forgotten city. I've walked down this alley countless times, yet every time it feels like a random and unfamiliar coin toss. A cruel dichotomy between the ideal we wish to see in the world, and the reality we are forced to live in.

    It feels like a lifetime ago when a fresh faced young Danny made his way to Abaddon City, walking down these very same alleys, ready to save the world just like any other naive rookie. Back then, it was much easier to feel invincible when the only thing separating you and the world was just a black and white lens.

    However, spend enough time out in this world and you quickly begin to realize that ideals are neither weapons or bulletproof vests. That come end of the day, your ideals are nothing but limitations and rules. Rules that put you at a disadvantage against people who do not care to play by them in the first place. <!-- I've seen men and women come and go, all lost somewhere between that fine line of good and evil, ideals and survival. Having spent so much time out on these streets, I'm always left wondering which side of that coin I'll end up at the end of the night. -->
